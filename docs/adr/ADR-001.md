# ADR-001: Apple-style Hybrid Navigation

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-09-17

## Context

The homepage previously reused the floating draggable menu everywhere, which clashed with the desired Apple-like hero experience and offered no distinct first-impression navigation pattern. We also needed a predictable way to expose the floating menu after users closed it, especially on subpages where the draggable window is the primary navigation.

## Decision

1. Introduce an Apple-inspired glass navigation bar that is visible only while the user is at the top of the home route.
2. Synchronize scroll position with menu state so that crossing a 120px threshold automatically opens the existing draggable menu and hides the hero bar.
3. Keep a compact three-dot toggle inside the sticky header when the draggable window is active, ensuring keyboard and pointer access to reopen the menu.
4. Default the floating menu to open on every non-home route while keeping the Apple bar disabled there.

## Consequences

- The hero section now delivers a differentiated first impression without sacrificing the advanced draggable menu.
- Scroll-driven state management introduces a dependency on `window.scrollY`; the Navbar must guard against server-side rendering contexts.
- Additional CSS was required to style the new hero bar while keeping reduced-motion users in mind.
- Documentation must highlight the dual-state navigation so designers and developers understand when each pattern appears.
